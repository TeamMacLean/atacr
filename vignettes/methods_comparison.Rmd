```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Simulated data

Our capture RNAseq data has a double peak in the count distribution. Here is a density plot of WT counts from RNAseq data

```{r cars}
plot(density(log(atacr::athal_wt_counts)))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
