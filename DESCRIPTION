Description: atacr helps with the analysis of count data from ATAC-seq experiments.
    Using BioConductor RangedSummarizedExperiment objects, atacr implements a set of helper
    functions and quality control plots specific to the analysis of particularly windows.
    Especially, atacr is useful for performing control window based normalisations and for
    easily running tests for differentially accessible windows in common reference designs with 
    multiclass data.
