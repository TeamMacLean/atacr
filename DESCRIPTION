Description: This package helps with the analysis of count data from capture-seq experiments.
    Using BioConductor RangedSummarizedExperiment objects, atacr implements a set of helper
    functions and quality control plots specific to the analysis of particularly windows.
    Especially, atacr is useful for performing control window based between sample normalizations and for
    easily running tests for differentially accessible windows in common reference designs.
